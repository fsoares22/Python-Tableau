# Python-Tableau

A group assignment where python and tableau were used. The tableau dashboard was mainly created by a colleague with input from all group members.

I would share the link to the dashboard but it contains her name and at the moment I have not obtained her consent to share it on here. Some images from the dashboard can be found in the report.

I mainly contributed to the data cleaning/preparation/understanding, as well as the written portion of the report for these sections.

I also contributed to the final recommendations in the report.

Enjoy!
